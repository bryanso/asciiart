I'm looking for a software driver for by PC/XT clone that will make it
recognize hard disk space or extended memory as LIM 4.0 expanded memory.
My question here is:  What utility do you all recommend to do this?
I've heard of a program called "Above Disk" that does this trick and
would like to try it out.  However, I understand there are several more
utilities that do the same function in different manners.  What I'd like
to do is try several and figure out which does the best job for my
configuration.  Which leads me to my next question.

Is there a company that rents software so that users may try them out
before making a purchasing decision?  Again, I've heard there's one in
L.A. but don't know any specifics.  I don't want to appear to be a
software pirate, but don't want to commit my money to something I will
be unhappy with.  Any comments, suggestions and/or assistance will be
appreciated!  :)
