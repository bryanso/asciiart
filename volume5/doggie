Um...According to the license I read, PKZIP does not *require* a
registration fee, it only asks for one.  Isn't that freeware?
Also, ZIP is quickly gaining use on Unix machines.

The -AV option requires a special serial number, hopefully known only to
the original vendor who packed the archive.  Thus you cannot actually
recreate an archive with verification unless you are a serial number
holder, and that is controlled by PK-Ware.
