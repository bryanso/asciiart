   lt has been at least a copy of years, may be three, that I
 found my interest in publishing ASCII art faded.  I attribute 
 that to too much work, which actually means too lazy.  Luckily,
 saving good, new pictures is not much effort.  For this reason,
 my collection keeps increasing in size.

   _
   (his volume has two themes, cartoon characters and animals, 
 which are somewhat related since many cartoon figures are animals.
 The first computer art I ever encountered was a large Mickey
 mouse printed in 132 column, green&white striped paper, with a 
 calendar at the bottom.  One of my aunties gave me that.  In this
 volume, 132 column pictures has .132 as filename suffix.  But I 
 don't know if it's easy to find 132 printers around any more.
